The first is a resource management game meant to teach how to run a business, and this game is now used in a MSU class.  The second is a choose your path kind of game to make finding resources easier for those who need to find them from the business college.</p>

                        <p>Some notable projects I've done for some MSU classes.  The first a partial recreation of Mega Man 2's Woodsman Stage in Unity.  The second an Unreal grappling parkour game where you must swing to the end without hitting the ground and doing so fast enough to avoid running out of time.  The third a stealth platformer game where you must get to the end without being spotted which was also made in Unreal.  Finally is a 3D FPS game made in Unity where you must find and defeat all the enemies.</p>
